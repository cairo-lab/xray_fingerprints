    "The questions being looked at are all multiple choice in their answers. The food questions are even ordinal. Yet the majority of research out there is using binary thresholds. This is a bit of cheat. An algorithm that randomly guesses already has an AUC of 50%. Thus papers that report an AUC of 60+% isn't saying much. It is able to detect a minor pattern beyond guessing. That could be statistical noise. To show this, we will play the same game. Thus we must find thresholds to binarize by that will tell a good story."
